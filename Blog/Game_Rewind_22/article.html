                        <h2>Foreword</h2>
                        <p>2022 was by far one of the most interesting years of my life. I graduated college, moved out
                            of
                            state, and completely changed careers in twelve short months. It was an extremely hard year
                            for
                            me, but just as rewarding. Despite all that was happening in my life, though, it proved to
                            be a
                            great year in gaming. I built a new gaming PC and completed a staggering 27 games and DLC.
                            With the year over, I'd like to reflect on the titles I played in brief, tweet-like
                            considerations on each. Rather than write exhaustive reviews, I'll briefly focus on the
                            merits
                            and demerits I personally found in each title in chronological order.</p>

                        <h2>Rating System</h2>
                        <p>I find number values to be inadequate to accurately describe one's opinions of a game, so
                            using
                            descriptors is my preference. I rate games based on a slightly-adapted version of <a
                                href="https://www.accursedfarms.com/posts/other-videos/gamelistvideo/?v=1">Ross
                                Scott's</a>
                            rating system, which he employs on his similar list of completed and uncompleted games. The
                            system is as follows:
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Fantastic:</b> My life is better because I played these games. It doesn't mean the game
                            has no
                            problems, but the highs are so high I don't care about the lows.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Good/Great:</b> Any game with this rating has my full seal of approval. I had no regrets
                            playing this. Something about it kept it from being one of one of the best gaming
                            experiences I've ever had, but that's not a mark against it.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Hazy:</b> If you ask me what I thought of a game and I have to stop and think about it,
                            then it
                            gets this rating. It's got something going for it, but I beat the game and still don't know
                            how I feel about it.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Love & Hate:</b> These are games that would great if not for very serious issues. These
                            games
                            have extremely strong points underscored by very bad shortcomings.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Doubt:</b> Games like this would probably be “Hazy,” but the longer I play them, the more
                            I want
                            them to be over. These are games that make me feel I was tricked into playing something
                            hollow. These games may still be competent, but not good.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Pass:</b> These are not necessarily bad games. In fact, many of these can be great games.
                            What
                            it means is it's the wrong game. These are games that just aren't for me, but were still
                            finished.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Bad:</b> These are games I played-through completely but I can in no way recommend. These
                            games
                            I probably didn't want to finish but still did out of some sense of resentment or pride.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Retired:</b> These are games that have been retired from the queue due to a misalignment
                            of
                            taste or a shortfall of quality.
                            <br></br>
                            With that established, let's get to it!

                    <p class="">What a way to start the year. I originally was introduced to this game by Jacob Geller's
                        video Fear of Cold. I'm a sucker for city-builders, especially those in unique situations and
                        environments. When I first saw the concept of a steampunk-esque city kept barely alive through
                        an icy apocalypse, I was immediately in love.<br></br>
                        I won't beat around it, Frostpunk is hard— and it should be. Your objective is to grow your city
                        through a pre-determined series of existential crises while unraveling a narrative about class
                        struggle. How you approach each situation is largely up to the player, and you balance morality
                        in the same way you balance your primary resources. Frostpunk keeps you on your frost-bitten
                        toes, constantly making you think, “If we can sacrifice a little more, make due with a little
                        less, give up just slightly more of our humanity, maybe we can make it.” I was hooked the entire
                        campaign. Only after beating it did I learn that Frostpunk is actually made of multiple
                        campaigns, each telling a new story in a different city's problems. That was an incredible treat
                        to discover. Each campaign is just as harrowing as the next, constantly mixing up mechanics to
                        keep you from being too good at any given start.<br></br>
                        Frostpunk landed comfortably in my highest rating category for games, and I recommend it to any
                        city-building enthusiast.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="">Coming off the high of Frostpunk, I was incredibly disappointed by what's touted as
                        11-Bit Studios' previous masterwork, This War of Mine. This War of Mine is a game about what is
                        easily Frostpunk's weakest element— morality.</r>
                        Set in a nondescript war-torn city that's
                        definitely not Sarjevo, This War of Mine is a game about gathering resources and keeping a small
                        group of people alive through miserable conditions. I couldn't stand it. This War of Mine fails
                        to add anything new to conversations about conflict. It's entire premise is, “War is bad,” which
                        is easily one of the least controversial statements someone could make. On top of that, I
                        couldn't help but feel it was incredibly insensitive to gamify a real struggle that far-too-many
                        people experience every day. I'd say you might as well make a game about starvation and
                        homelessness, but This War of Mine is already a game about that, too. I put it down after a few
                        days.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="">When I first saw Disco Elysium talked about at The Game Awards in 2019, I thought it
                        looked like a generic far-too-full-of-itself indie walking simulator created by egotist indie
                        developers. I was almost right. Disco Elysium is, however, anything but generic. I first heard
                        Disco Elysium described as, “A detective story at the end of the world,” an admittedly
                        interesting premise. But that undersells it. Disco Elysium's end of the world, The Pale, is a
                        geographic one. The story takes place in a fantastical radio-punk world separated from others by
                        seas of un-reality. That world, though, is really only ever seen in the periphery. It's
                        narrative is far more down-to-earth, almost hauntingly so.<br></br>
                        Written by self-described communists living in a failed communist state, Disco Elysium takes
                        place entirely within a city known as Martinaise that never truly recovered from a failed
                        communist revolution and it's subsequent foreign occupation. Communism, fascism, and a handful
                        of other in-universe ideologies are duking it out in the streets— the culmination of 10,000
                        years of struggle. But not as armies or faceless ideologies; as people, and as your own
                        thoughts. Unlike any other game I've played, you build your character by strengthening which
                        parts of your literal inner monologue speak the most. These voices constantly comment on one
                        another, your actions, and the events of Disco Elysium's narrative. One of the best moments I've
                        ever experienced in a game was after stepping out of Disco Elysium's starting area— the
                        Whirling-In-Rags— into a rainy Martinaise morning and hearing Shivers richly describe the city
                        in a profoundly poetic monologue. Disco Elysium is full of itself, yes, and it's developers have
                        become infamously narcissistic, but Disco Elysium deserves to take itself seriously. It, and
                        it's writers, have a lot to say worth hearing.<br></br>
                        Not only do I consider Disco Elysium to be a phenomenal example of what video games can do to
                        set themselves apart from other media, I consider it one of the most important pieces of
                        literature this decade.</p>

                    <p class="">I've been a die-hard Supergiant fan since the launch of Transistor back in 2014.
                        Everything they make is a masterpiece. The weird thing about the discussion surrounding this
                        game, though, is that Hades seems to only be compared to Transistor and never the game that came
                        between that and Hades, Pyre. Hades, to me, feels much more like an evolution of Pyre than any
                        other of Supergiant's other titles. Honestly, Transistor is the least similar Supergiant game to
                        Hades when you bring Bastion into the comparison. Normally I hate rogue-lights and games that
                        require the player to frequently repeat the same content, but Hades is a special case. It's
                        environments, music, and characters make ever play-through extremely engaging. Every run feels
                        like a tangible accomplishment, especially as you start to crank up the difficulty. I'm excited
                        for this one's sequel.</p>

                    <p class="">Yeah, we're at the fourth “fantastic” rated game on this list so far, but can you blame
                        me? I started 2023 with banger after banger. The next ones won't all be rated as high, I
                        promise.
                        I've played a lot of MMOs in my day. My two most-played games ever are World of Warcraft and EVE
                        Online. When I started college, my interest in WoW fell off a cliff, and I just didn't have
                        enough time for EVE. I shouldn't have paid it much mind at the time, but the WoW exodus to FFXIV
                        caught my eye, and I really wanted to try it. After Square Enix closed trial access while they
                        upgraded their servers, I immediately created an account. Boy, am I glad I did.<br></br>
                        FFXIV is one of the best MMOs I've ever played. Its story isn't incredibly engaging to start
                        with, but once you get past the base vanilla campaign and the pre-heavenward stuff starts, it
                        cranks up to 10. FFXIV excels in emergent gameplay and community, which most other theme-park
                        style MMOs neglect. I love walking into an adventurer's guild and hearing a group of bards
                        playing music or eavesdropping on conversations by the Limsa Lominsa aetherite.<br></br>
                        It's class/job system is also incredibly unique, allowing players to switch between play styles
                        at will. I want to play exclusively healers, so I'm excited to eventually graduate from White
                        Mage and start trying other classes.<br></br>
                        FFXIV's singular shortcoming is in world design. While its maps are huge and beautiful, FFXIV
                        never lets the player slow down and enjoy them for long periods. The player is constantly moving
                        from zone to zone, sometimes crossing Eorzea twice in a single quest. Because of that, it's hard
                        for the player to grow an attachment to the world itself. That attachment is important in an
                        MMO, and it's the main reason I love both World of Warcraft and EVE Online so much. Maybe once I
                        reach max level and start leveling other classes I'll finally get to take my time in each zone
                        like I want.</p>

                    <p class="">I was a big fan of Nier: Automata when I first played it in 2017. For whatever reason,
                        though, I just couldn't get into Replicant. Despite it's similarities to Automata, I found the
                        story, combat, and world significantly less engaging than it's sequel. I ended up putting this
                        game down after about 14 hours. Just not my style, I guess.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="">Since this is actually the second time I've played this game, it doesn't get a formal
                        rating score. The fact that I replayed it, though, should be a good indicator of my opinion on
                        it. I first played Plants vs. Zombies as a kid on my first phone, an iPhone 4, so it felt right
                        to play it again on a mobile device. Most of my time playing this game was on my iPad Pro
                        between classes at school.<br></br>
                        Plants vs. Zombies has aged incredibly gracefully. The one thing that I noticed the second time
                        around, though, was that the game is ridiculously easy. Once you figure out one extremely basic
                        plant formation, you can employ it on nearly every level to great success. I only ever had to
                        restart a level once, and it was one of the wildcard arcade levels where you get random plants.
                        That's a relatively minor complaint, though. I still think this is a must-play classic.</p>

                    <p class="">Zelda is generally one of those series I wish I liked more than I actually do. Skyward
                        Sword's remaster on Nintendo Switch initially hooked me, despite it's janky adapted motion
                        controls. I thought the character writing, particularly between Link and Zelda, was
                        adorable.<br></br>
                        Unfortunately, I dread backtracking and time-consuming puzzles. After getting through the
                        initial set of dungeons, the player is asked to go through each of them again in a different
                        way. That immediately turned me off. I tried to stick with it, but ended up retiring the game
                        after about 15 hours. </p>

                    <p class="">I graduated from college in May of 2022. As a reward for five years of grueling work, I
                        built myself an awesome gaming PC intended to play most games at max settings, in 4K, at 120
                        FPS. The first game I chose to break this computer in on was… a game from 2008. I'm honestly not
                        sure why I made that choice. I guess I just felt it was time to tackle this classic.Dead Space,
                        like another zombie game mentioned above, has aged incredibly well. It's actually aged so well
                        I'm surprised (and a bit frustrated) a remake was announced almost immediately after I completed
                        it. Its visuals are cohesive enough that you don't really notice it's lack of visual fidelity,
                        and its atmosphere and sound design draws the Ishimura together into a disturbingly immersive
                        environment. I haven't yet played Dead Space's remake, but if it's even half as good the
                        original, I'll need to. Great game, all around.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="">Frostpunk's first major expansion, The Last Autumn, is set in the months leading up to
                        the winter that sets the events of the base game in motion. It's an interesting and subversive
                        spin on the game's formula, which still has a lot of mileage left in it.<br></br>
                        I had fun with The Last Autumn, but overall felt it had a less compelling narrative and more
                        frustrating series of objectives than the base game. The pressure put on the player in it's
                        story is artificial, which makes it annoying to lose to. Instead of fighting against the forces
                        of nature, the player is constantly struggling against incompetent bureaucracy and seemingly
                        arbitrary deadlines set by an overseas administration. Fail to meet any of these deadlines and
                        it's game over. It doesn't matter how well you're doing by any other measure, or if you're only
                        a couple hours behind, you're met with instant loss. Because you aren't surviving a massive
                        catastrophe, the end also doesn't quite hit the same. It's just kind of over when it's over.
                        Still worth playing for any Frostpunk fan, though.</p>

                    <p class="">Dead Space 2 was, naturally, the second game I played on my new rig. There's little I
                        can add to the public conversation surrounding Dead Space 2 that hasn't already been said. It's
                        great, but in different ways than the original Dead Space. The story feels like a natural
                        progression, and being set on a giant, futuristic space habitat is extremely cool. Dead Space 2
                        is best known for being heavier on action than on horror. I don't think this is inherently a bad
                        thing. I'm someone who appreciates developers experimenting with their titles rather than
                        falling into a cycle of making the same game over and over. Though you might not scream and cry
                        like the original Dead Space encourages, it's still sitting at a 94% positive rating on Steam
                        for a reason. Give it a shot.</p>

                    <p class="">Frostpunk's other main expansion is significantly smaller than The Last Autumn, clocking
                        in at about half the length. Unlike any of the game's other scenarios, On the Edge is a direct
                        followup to the base-game's main story. It's about as experimental as any of the other scenarios
                        in the base-game, this time adding a settlement trading feature. You also don't have a generator
                        to keep your village warm, though it doesn't get nearly as cold as you're used to dealing with
                        by this point. In all, it's more of the same, which is in no way a bad thing. If you love

                    </div>
                    <p class="">I started this game in an odd period of my life where I had just moved to another state
                        for my first post-college job. Since the tiny mining town we had relocated to had no available
                        housing for my then-fiancé and I for nearly a month after arriving, we were stuck in a
                        one-bedroom AirBNB with the entirety of our possessions, still in their boxes, crammed anywhere
                        we could fit them. All forms of entertainment were inaccessible to me except for my
                        3DS.<br></br>
                        I'm a pretty big Fire Emblem fan. I've been slowly trying to get through every post-SNES title,
                        which has been a monumental undertaking. After completing a number of GBA and Gamecube Fire
                        Emblem titles, however, returning to the more-contemporary 3DS family of games was a breath of
                        fresh air. Shadows of Valentia has a beautiful art style and incredibly compelling story,
                        coupled with a handful of frustrating new weak points in the franchise's otherwise highly
                        polished gameplay loop.<br></br>
                        Unlike any other Fire Emblem title at the time, Shadows of Valentia requires the player to
                        undergo sequences of dungeon crawling to obtain items, experience certain dialogue, and promote
                        units. If there's one thing players buy Fire Emblem for, it is absolutely not dungeon crawling.
                        Even worse, this is one of the Fire Emblem titles where you can hard-block your progression as
                        you near the final boss by inadvertently under-leveling your characters or leveling the wrong
                        ones. The 3DS Fire Emblem games have a serious problem with that.</p>

                    <p class="">This is the most painful entry for me on this list. Those that know me know that I'm a
                        massive Halo fan. I've read dozens of it's novels, played every game, including its obscure
                        mobile spin-offs, and have long been a staunch defender of 343i. To this day I'm the only person
                        I've ever met who genuinely loved Halo 5. When it was announced that Infinite was going to be an
                        open world game, I was skeptical but hopeful 343i could pull it off.<br></br>
                        Unfortunately, Halo: Infinite ended up being the first piece of Halo media I genuinely didn't
                        enjoy. It's a complete mess from start to finish. Not only does it double down on all the
                        mistakes Halo fans criticized previous games for most, it's a confusing jumble of conflicting
                        design philosophy and narrative direction. The subsequent internal buckling of 343i says a lot
                        about fan response to this title. The series really should have ended gracefully years ago.</p>

                    <p class="">I was an FPS player growing up, but as far as multi-player console titles went, I
                        generally just stuck with Halo. Throughout school, I'd always heard good things about the
                        campaigns of Battlefield and Call of Duty. One of my micro-goals for 2022 was to play more FPS
                        games again. I figured I'd start with Battlefield 3, since at the time I was in the mood for a
                        more realistic modern-era shooter.<br></br>
                        I was shocked by how bad it's campaign was. I ended up forcing myself to finish it.
                        Battlefield's campaign exists only because it was the norm at the time, not because the
                        developers wanted to do anything good with it.

                    <p class="">Subnautica is a favorite of mine. I've beaten it three or four times by now, originally
                        starting early in the game's early access period. In fact, I was one of the first people in the
                        world to actually finish this game at launch. I watched the developer launch-party live-stream,
                        then immediately played the game from start to finish, staying up through the night without even
                        taking a sleep break.<br></br>
                        No playthrough will ever quite recapture that first sense of wonder I experienced after my
                        initial drop onto the oceans of Planet 4546B, but the fact that it keeps calling me back is a
                        testament to how good it is mechanically. Unlike most of Subnautica's open-world survival game
                        contemporaries, Subnautica is mostly-linear and narrative driven. It compels the player from
                        place to place not just to get better gear, but to experience a thrilling story and it's
                        conclusion. It's a masterpiece.

                    <p class="">In late 2022, I got into a creepy monster hunting mood. I'd intended to start The
                        Witcher for a while, and figured it was the perfect opportunity. Imagine my disappointment when
                        it turns out that The Witcher is much more about medieval fantasy politics than monster hunting.
                        While historically that wouldn't have been a dealbreaker for me, the train wreck formerly known
                        as Game of Thrones pretty much killed all of my interest in that kind of story.<br></br>
                        After Game of Thrones, I've seen every sort of fantasy political intrigue. No story feels new,
                        and I have difficulty buying in when I know that— much like in Game of Thrones— none of it will
                        pay off in a satisfying way. Another complaint I had about The Witcher was it's lack of player
                        freedom. I wanted to play as an apathetic, impolite mercenary. Unfortunately, while the game
                        gives the player a degree of wiggle room in how they approach conversations, it doesn't do it in
                        a way that lets you be anything other than CD Projekt Red's tightly-scripted Geralt of Rivia. It
                        makes me question what the point is in giving a player options. I won't get around to playing
                        The Witcher 2 anytime soon.

                        first time I'd get the canon ending. While aged, Stalker remains incredibly atmospheric,
                        stimulating an aesthetic itch few other pieces of media can. I look forward to playing Clear Sky
                        at a later point.

                        Eternal didn't leave a lasting impression on me, but it deserves it's “Fantastic” rating by
                        merit of being a near-perfect game. It's mechanics are polished to a reflective sheen, perfectly
                        blending movement, level design, enemy difficulty, and gunplay. I highly recommend it,

                    <p class="">Control was another incredibly disappointing title. With how hyped up this game was and
                        it's beautiful art direction, I was expecting something really special. Unfortunately, Control
                        ends up being a cookie-cutter shadow government story with a sprinkle of originality in how they
                        structure the game's setting, a supernatural building known as “The Oldest House.”It's combat is
                        bad. It feels like a third-person shooter from 2010, doing nothing but filling rooms with
                        copy-pasted bullet-sponge enemies. If you're considering picking up Control, do yourself a favor
                        and skip it.

                    <p class="">Being the first open world game of it's franchise, Metro: Exodus does a fantastic job.
                        In many ways, it's a lot like a modern take on Stalker. What holds it back, however, is how
                        small the areas you're in feel. The player barely gets the opportunity to build familiarity with
                        each environment before the story pushes them somewhere new. Granted, this could be justified by
                        the fact that each destination is just a stop on a much longer trans-Siberian railway journey,
                        but I feel like an additional two or three hours in each zone would have gone a long way. I also
                        feel that Metro lost something in abandoning its unique tunnel setting, something I'd hope to
                        see the franchise return to if it continues. All in all, though, great game. Undoubtedly a
                        must-play for any Metro or Stalker fan.

                    </div>
                    <p class="">Earlier, I brought up my immense love for the original Subnautica title, so tackling its
                        sequel in 2022 was a no-brainer. Below Zero does much differently than its predecessor,
                        particularly in trading its silent protagonist for a voiced one. I know this was a controversial
                        choice, but it's one I didn't have a problem with. I felt that it's story and expanded building
                        systems were both welcome additions to the franchise. My singular qualm about the game, though,
                        is that its underwater environments feel generally less varied and visually interesting than the
                        original. There are certainly some really cool zones, both above and below the ocean, but unlike
                        the original, not all of them felt completely finished or worth spending much time in. Below
                        Zero feels like a very large DLC, which is exactly what it started as. That's not something I
                        hold against it, though, and from start to finish it was an enjoyable experience.

                    <p class="">This DLC for Metro: Exodus does something very cool, which is telling and intertwining
                        the stories of two dead characters that take place over different periods of time.
                        Unfortunately, its gameplay isn't particularly interesting. A massive portion of it sees the
                        player clearing grime out of the inside of a tunnel system using only a flamethrower. While this
                        would be an interesting break in normal gameplay if placed inside the base game, it's not enough
                        to stand on its own, particular for as long as the DLC pushes it for. Given its ~2 hour length,
                        I'd recommend it for hardcore Metro fans based on the merit of its storytelling, but not to most
                        casual players.

                        Skyrim felt complex just for the sake of adding complexity, not with a greater vision in mind,
                        and from the start it's absurdly difficult to the point of being player-hostile. I think many of
                        this game's fans confuse high-effort with high-quality. I ended up moving on after a few hours.

                        has an engaging story with interesting mission premises, high-budget cinematics, and major,
                        long-lasting implications on the franchise's story. Bafflingly, 343i chose to punctuate this
                        with long, boring firefight-esque gameplay sections that often repeat on identical levels— many
                        of which are already multiplayer levels players could have previously spent dozens of hours on.
                        I played it alone, but it probably would have been more engaging with friends. In all, its
                        something that should be played by hardcore Halo fans (like myself) for its story, but it's
                        forgotten about by most of the playerbase and 343i for a reason.

                    <p class="">There's little I can say about Elden Ring that hasn't been said exhaustively by
                        thousands of essayists and game critics. What I can do, however, is tell you about my own
                        experience with it. While I've always liked the lore behind Soulsborne, watching dozens of hours
                        of lore analysis videos on all the games, I've never been a particularly big fan of the series'
                        gameplay. The only non-Elden Ring FromSoft title I own is Bloodborne, and I only ever made it to
                        that game's third boss.<br></br>
                        I expected a similar experience with Elden Ring. I downloaded it using a friend's Steam library
                        and started it up certain I would hate it. I absolutely struggled, b-lining it basically
                        straight to the game's first story boss, “Margit, The Fell Omen.” By the time I got to him I was
                        under-geared, under-leveled, and under-skilled. I was instantly destroyed, naturally. But I
                        wasn't going to let myself be filtered at a boss. I told myself I was going to beat it before
                        putting down the game to save myself the ridicule I would inevitably face from my friends
                        otherwise. I spent three-and-a-half hours straight throwing myself at him again, and again, and
                        again, never suspecting that I'd gotten here prematurely. In my mind, FromSoft games are hard,
                        so this was just par for the course. Eventually, to my great relief, I finally beat him. I told
                        my friends that it was an interesting game, just not one for me.The next day, all I thought
                        about was Elden Ring. Whatever happened that night, something clicked. I got it. Like most other
                        players, Elden Ring ended up consuming my life until I finished it. I can't wait for the DLC.

                    <p class="">Despite being unimpressed by Battlefield 3's campaign, I installed Battlefield 4. This
                        decision is what gamers call, “a mistake.” It was by far the worst FPS I played in 2022, and I
                        ended up retiring it. Moral of the story: avoid the campaigns of multiplayer-focused FPS.

                    <p class="">It Takes Two won TGA's 2021 Game of the Year. It deserved it. A co-op only campaign, It
                        Takes Two is a truly special game in the current gaming era. Players see themselves taking on an
                        incredible diversity of two-man tasks across a staggering number of beautifully-designed
                        environments. Each player controls one of two main characters, a couple on the verge of divorce,
                        as they rediscover their love for one another. I played this with my wife, and we absolutely
                        loved it. I'd definitely consider it a game for couples, though, as two of our single friends
                        played it together and didn't like it nearly as much. If you're looking for a game to play with
                        your partner, though, this is it!

                    <p class="">By far the most obscure game on this list, Peter Bell Saves Christmas is a seasonal
                        flash game published on Newgrounds in 2012. The game is a spinoff of the little-known but
                        much-loved series of holiday short films, Deck'd, by Dom Fera. Deck'd itself ran from 2009 to
                        2014, releasing nearly every December during that time. I'm the only person I've ever met who
                        kept up with it, and it holds very dear to my heart.<br></br>
                        In December of 2022, while rewatching the series, I discovered this flash game, which I had to
                        play. It's short, easy, and really cute. I adore the passion that went into it, and it was a
                        great way to end the year.

                    <p>2022 proved to be a great year for me in gaming. I got to play a whole host of fantastic, thought
                        provoking, beautiful, and fun new titles, in addition to replaying old favorites. The purchase
                        and assembly of my new gaming computer let me experience more art in higher fidelity than I ever
                        have before, while a surplus of time afforded to me by my career change let me spend more time
                        pursuing games. I hope my reflections have sparked an interest in playing any one of the great
                        titles I talked about. <br></br>
                        Here's to an equally great 2023!</p>
