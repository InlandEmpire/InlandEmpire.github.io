                    <h2>Foreword</h2>
                    <p>Since starting just over a year ago, homelabbing has become my number one technical hobby. While
                        my expectations were low, having only conceptualized my server first as a network-attached
                        storage device, I quickly learned how much a dedicated home server is capable of. As my
                        ambitions grew, so did my technical knowledge, which skyrocketed to include robust
                        understandings of network infrastructure, computer hardware, and distributed systems.
                        Unfortunately, since I knew so little starting out, I made a number of mistakes in choosing
                        hardware. Had I been exposed to more information beforehand, I would have made very different
                        component choices in my build.To hopefully help someone down the road, I've compiled this list
                        of each of my components where I explain the logic supporting their inclusion. </p>

                    <h2>Use cases</h2>
                    <p>My homelab serves a number of simultaneous roles. The current build is optimized for the
                        following:<br>
                        • High capacity network-attached storage<br>
                        • Parallel virtualization<br>
                        • 24/7 Seeding<br>
                        • DNS Sink Ad Blocking<br>
                        • Internal Wiki hosting<br>
                        • Media Streaming (Jellyfin to Infuse)<br>
                        • Bare-metal performance VM gaming</p>

                            <p class="entry_explainer">When I first built my rig, I didn't have space to hide a server
                                rack in my home. Because
                                of that, aesthetics and presentability were important. I wanted something small and
                                inconspicuous that could reside anywhere from a living room to a home office.
                                Fortunately, Swedish case manufacturer Fractal Design created the Node 804— a Micro ATX
                                NAS/homelab case. Its bifurcated design supports a whopping eight 3.5” drives, an
                                additional four 2.5” drives and one 5.25” optical drive, all in an elegant cube form
                                factor. The Node line is a favorite among homelabbers, and it was the perfect choice for
                                me. As I love the cyberpunk style, I've added dozens of tech-themed stickers to the
                                front and side panels from Defcon and other events.</p>

                                dedicate an entire CCD to my gaming VM, giving me the equivalent of an entire 5800x for
                                gaming. The remaining 8 cores are dedicated to Unraid applications and smaller VMs as
                                needs arise. While the absence of an integrated GPU is a pain when trying to access my
                                BIOS, AMD iGPUs are so useless in server tasks (i.e. transcoding and LLMs) that I'd take
                                a higher core count any day.

                            server, expanded RAM became a must. According to my expected needs, 64GB was plenty. I had
                            already known Ryzen 5000 series chips performed better when using dual-channel RAM, so I
                            chose to opt for four RAM modules— the maximum my motherboard supports. I was troubled to
                            discover, however, that AM4 chips struggle with RAM stability at 3600MT/s across two
                            channels. Because of that, I down-clock my RAM to 3200MT/s. There was no real price
                            difference between 3600MT/S and 3200MT/s, so thankfully I don't feel as though I wasted
                            money on speed I don't use.</p>

                        <p class="entry_explainer">After deciding to add my RTX 3080 to my server, the need arose to
                            upgrade my PSU. Like most servers, I maintain 24/7 uptime— a situation where power
                            efficiency is paramount. With that in mind, I decided to go with the highest PSU efficiency
                            rating: titanium. Most titanium PSUs are high-wattage, and since I intend to continue adding
                            drives until I physically cant anymore, I'll take as many watts as I can get. Antec uses the
                            exact same hardware as Seasonic, but sells it for a fraction of the price. The ST1000 in
                            particular is fully modular with plenty of cables for molex and SATA that allows me to
                            continue scaling past my case.</p>

                                By routing cables from the server's PSU out the back of the case and using a few
                                adapters, I power an additional 8 drives. To initialize the data connections, though,
                                I'd need an HBA (host bus adapter)— one that's externally facing. The LSA 9200-8e cards
                                are available for cheap second hand, and I snagged one from beloved homelab parts vendor
                                TheArtofServer off eBay. For mounting and cooling the drives, I just use acrylic

                                drives within the healthy temperature range. I added five 120mm Be Quiet fans which cool
                                both my GPU and the internal 3.5” drive array. Be Quiet fans are also extremely quiet,
                                which I value in a computer.

                                its cost. Being able to add and remove disks of varied size, protect them with
                                parity, rapidly spin up VMs, and one-click install for thousands of Docker
                                containers easily makes it worth it. Going with Unraid was the best decision I made

                                drives, I need to maximize what I can buy. 18TB disks are best for my budget. Two of
                                them are parity drives that protect my array from up to two simultaneous drive failures.
                                I also use a 4TB NVMe as Unraid's cache and a 1TB NVMe that hosts VM vdisks.

                <p><b>You need more than you think.</b><br>
                    I replaced nearly every part of my server in the first year I had it. I wish I knew ahead of time
                    that a homelab is capable of being far more than a NAS. Even if you don't think you'll utilize the
                    power you're buying, sooner or later you will use it.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Buy secondhand.</b><br>
                    I bought almost every server part from secondhand stores like eBay and ServerPartsDeals. In doing
                    so,
                    I've saved almost 60% vs. MSRP had I bought each component new.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Homelabs can be everything you want at the same time.</b><br>
                    My homelab is the most capable system in my house. It games AND hosts game servers at the same time.
                    It's a DNS sink, seed box, site host, and NAS— usually all at once! If you build a homelab
                    correctly, it'll be the only computer you ever need. So go big!
