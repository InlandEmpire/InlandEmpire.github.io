                <p class="">What a way to start the year. I originally was introduced to this game by Jacob Geller’s video Fear of Cold. I’m a sucker for city-builders, especially those in unique situations and environments. When I first saw the concept of a steampunk-esque city kept barely alive through an icy apocalypse, I was immediately in love.<br>
                    I won’t beat around it, Frostpunk is hard— and it should be. Your objective is to grow your city through a pre-determined series of existential crises while unraveling a narrative about class struggle. How you approach each situation is largely up to the player, and you balance morality in the same way you balance your primary resources. Frostpunk keeps you on your frost-bitten toes, constantly making you think, “If we can sacrifice a little more, make due with a little less, give up just slightly more of our humanity, maybe we can make it.” I was hooked the entire campaign. Only after beating it did I learn that Frostpunk is actually made of multiple campaigns, each telling a new story in a different city’s problems. That was an incredible treat to discover. Each campaign is just as harrowing as the next, constantly mixing up mechanics to keep you from being too good at any given start.<br>
                    Frostpunk landed comfortably in my highest rating category for games, and I recommend it to any city-building enthusiast.</p>
