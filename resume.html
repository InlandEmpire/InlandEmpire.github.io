        <h2> Hacker & QA Engineer | Quality-first in design, automation, and life.</h2>
        <p>As a software tester with a strong professional background in SaaS and banking, I understand the
            importance of delivering secure, high-quality products. Emphasis on quality is a philosophy I've taken to
            heart--
            applying it in all areas of my life. I specialize in creating time-efficient, highly maintainable mobile and
            desktop test automation while employing robust penetration testing to catch vulnerabilities before they ever
            hit production. I work with remote, Agile-oriented teams in full-time positions.</p>

                <h4>Senior Software QA Engineer</h4>
                <p>I have had the privilege to work with, mentor, and manage Tristan at the start of his QA career. When
                    I hired him, he had no professional experience in QA or software, but he came to the interview
                    prepared like no one I had ever seen. He had written automation code to test our company website,
                    had taken classes and essentially trained himself for the position of QA automation engineer. I was
                    absolutely blown away, and so we hired him.
                    <br>
                    Once Tristan started working, he proved himself to be everything I had hoped for and then some. He
                    is an extremely quick and motivated learner and worker. He took feedback really well and in a very
                    short time, was writing professional, enterprise-level automation code. When he joined, we had a
                    backlog of tests to automate and could not keep up with the output of our development team. Because
                    of his work ethic and his ability to pick up new concepts so quickly, our automation test backlog
                    was quickly decimated and we got to the point where we could work in sprint with developers. That
                    would not have been possible
                    without Tristan.
                    <br>
                    I would hire Tristan 1000 times over for any QA Automation or SDET position. He functions at a much
                    higher level than his years of experience would indicate. I would recommend him for any size company
                    from startup to large scale. He will adapt and kick a** at whatever task is set in front of him.
                    <br>
                    I am honored to have had the chance to work with him, and I learned at least as much from him as he
                    did from me.

                <h4>IT Business Analyist, Agile Auditor</h4>
                <p>I am thrilled to recommend Tristan Lundgreen, whose role as a Quality Assurance Analyst at Sunwest
                    Bank barely scratches the surface of his profound impact both on projects and on his colleagues.
                    <br>
                    Tristan is not just a fast learner but a natural leader and a seasoned mentor. He played a pivotal
                    role in encouraging and assisting me to achieve my ScrumMaster Certification, offering both the
                    technical insights and the motivational boosts needed to tackle such a challenge. His passion for
                    his work is infectious, making every goal seem attainable and every effort valued.
                    <br>
                    His meticulous attention to detail ensures that nothing is ever overlooked, contributing to flawless
                    project executions. Tristan combines this rigor with a remarkable emotional intelligence, making him
                    an empathetic coach and a trusted advisor who understands the challenges faced by his team and
                    addresses them proactively.
                    <br>
                    Tristan's goal-oriented approach drives his team forward, setting benchmarks that inspire all of us
                    to strive for excellence. His ability to balance this with genuine care for the team's professional
                    and personal growth makes him an exemplary figure in our bank.
                    <br>
                    I am profoundly grateful for his mentorship and genuinely excited to see how his career will unfold.
                    Tristan is a true asset to any team, and I am confident that he will continue to inspire and succeed
                    in all his future endeavors.

                <h4>DevOps Team Lead, QA Engineer</h4>
                <p>Tristan is a natural leader and motivator for those he works with. His passion for his work is
                    contagious! I had the absolute privilege to be mentored by him and it set me on a strong course in
                    my own QA career. Hardly a day goes by where I don't use something he taught me and I still find
                    myself coming to him for guidance on tricky situations and he is just as passionate and thorough as
                    ever.
                    <br>
                    Technology is not a job for Tristan, it's a hobby and a passion and you can reliably go to him for
                    anything tech related and he will know about it, how to do it, or how it works. Tristan is a
                    valuable resource for any company and a tremendous asset to any team. I couldn't give any stronger a
                    recommendation.

                        ability research new topics and become a knowledge expert in a short time. On top of seeking to
                        understand topics and others, he seeks for new ways to better his life, improve his work ethic,
                        and help grow others along with him. He is

                    <p>Tristan is a talented teacher and an even more talented QA engineer, and I've been extremely
                        lucky to have him as a mentor. He's an effective and efficient communicator, with a natural gift
                        for explaining and an infectious thirst for knowledge. I've never had a question he couldn't
                        find a satisfactory answer for, and I've asked him a good many. The technical knowledge and
                        practical experience he's given me has been invaluable, and its been incredible to see how
                        committed he is to continuing to grow and learn himself.
                        <br>
                        Tristan has worked hard to get where he is, and he has treated every challenge as a new
                        opportunity. I can't imagine a task he couldn't handle or an occasion he couldn't rise to. He
                        cares about doing quality work, and he raises everyone around him to that standard. Anyone would
                        be lucky to have

                <p>Tristan is unquestionably talented, innovative and thorough in his approach to QA Automation and
                    testing. He has excellent instincts and problem solving skills. His skills and abilities far exceed
                    his current level of experience.
                    <br>
                    Tristan's work ethic and extreme development prowess perfectly compliments his ability to acquire
                    any needed niche skills on the fly. He is articulate, hard-working, dedicated, and self-motivated,
                    with the willingness to learn and the ability to take on any new challenge presented him.
                    <br>
                    Working and learning from our QA Automation Lead (one of the best in the space) they were able to
                    reduce what appeared to be an insurmountable backlog in a matter of about 5 months. This allowed QA
                    Automation to start working on stories in the current sprint, enabling them to detect issues earlier
                    in development cycle resulting in an overall improvement of the team's velocity and code quality.
                    <br>
                    Tristan's professional attitude and good nature make him a pleasure to work with and I would welcome
                    an opportunity to be on a team with him again.
