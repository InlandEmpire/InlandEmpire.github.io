        <h2>Software Quality Assurance Engineer | Quality-first in design, automation, and life.</h2>
        <p>As a quality assurance engineer with a strong professional background in SaaS and banking, I understand the importance of delivering high-quality products. Emphasis on quality is a philosophy I've taken to heart-- applying it in all areas of my life. I specialize in creating time-efficient, highly maintainable mobile and desktop test automation using Python and Robot Framework while employing both manual and API testing to catch issues before they ever hit production. I work with agile-oriented teams in full-time positions.</p>

                    <h4>Senior Software QA Engineer</h4>
                    <p>I have had the privilege to work with, mentor, and manage Tristan at the start of his QA career. When I hired him, he had no professional experience in QA or software, but he came to the interview prepared like no one I had ever seen. He had written automation code to test our company website, had taken classes and essentially trained himself for the position of QA automation engineer. I was absolutely blown away, and so we hired him.
                        <br>
                        Once Tristan started working, he proved himself to be everything I had hoped for and then some. He is an extremely quick and motivated learner and worker. He took feedback really well and in a very short time, was writing professional, enterprise-level automation code. When he joined, we had a backlog of tests to automate and could not keep up with the output of our development team. Because of his work ethic and his ability to pick up new concepts so quickly, our automation test backlog was quickly decimated and we got to the point where we could work in sprint with developers. That would not have been possible without Tristan.
                        <br>
                        I would hire Tristan 1000 times over for any QA Automation or SDET position. He functions at a much higher level than his years of experience would indicate. I would recommend him for any size company from startup to large scale. He will adapt and kick a** at whatever task is set in front of him.
                        <br>
                        I am honored to have had the chance to work with him, and I learned at least as much from him as he did from me.</p>

                    <p>Tristan is a very talented and quality individual. Mentoring him has been an honor and an experience I won't forget. He applies 110% of himself into whatever he is doing and has the ability research new topics and become a knowledge expert in a short time. On top of seeking to understand topics and others, he seeks for new ways to better his life, improve his work ethic, and help grow others along with him. He is skilled and efficient in documenting bugs/defects, creating manual test cases, and automating those test cases using multiple frameworks. If you're looking for someone who is focus on getting the job done in a quality way, look no further.</p>

                    <p>Tristan is unquestionably talented, innovative and thorough in his approach to QA Automation and testing. He has excellent instincts and problem solving skills. His skills and abilities far exceed his current level of experience. 
                        <br>
                        Tristan's work ethic and extreme development prowess perfectly compliments his ability to acquire any needed niche skills on the fly. He is articulate, hard-working, dedicated, and self-motivated, with the willingness to learn and the ability to take on any new challenge presented him. 
                        <br>
                        Working and learning from our QA Automation Lead (one of the best in the space) they were able to reduce what appeared to be an insurmountable backlog in a matter of about 5 months. This allowed QA Automation to start working on stories in the current sprint, enabling them to detect issues earlier in development cycle resulting in an overall improvement of the team's velocity and code quality. 
                        <br>
                        Tristan's professional attitude and good nature make him a pleasure to work with and I would welcome an opportunity to be on a team with him again.</p>
