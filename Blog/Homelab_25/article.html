                    <h2>Foreword</h2>
                    <p>Since starting just over a year ago, homelabbing has become my number one technical hobby. While
                        my expectations were low, having only conceptualized my server first as a network-attached
                        storage device, I quickly learned how much a dedicated home server is capable of. As my
                        ambitions grew, so did my technical knowledge, which skyrocketed to include robust
                        understandings of network infrastructure, computer hardware, and distributed systems.
                        Unfortunately, since I knew so little starting out, I made a number of mistakes in choosing
                        hardware. Had I been exposed to more information beforehand, I would have made very different
                        component choices in my build.To hopefully help someone down the road, I've compiled this list
                        of each of my components where I explain the logic supporting their inclusion. </p>

                    <h2>Use cases</h2>
                    <p>My homelab serves a number of simultaneous roles. The current build is optimized for the
                        following:<br>
                        • High capacity network-attached storage<br>
                        • Parallel virtualization<br>
                        • 24/7 Seeding<br>
                        • DNS Sink Ad Blocking<br>
                        • Internal Wiki hosting<br>
                        • Media Streaming (Jellyfin to Infuse)<br>
                        • Bare-metal performance VM gaming</p>

                            <p class="entry_explainer">When I first built my rig, I didn't have space to hide a server
                                rack in my home. Because
                                of that, aesthetics and presentability were important. I wanted something small and
                                inconspicuous that could reside anywhere from a living room to a home office.
                                Fortunately, Swedish case manufacturer Fractal Design created the Node 804— a Micro ATX
                                NAS/homelab case. It's bifurcated design supports a whopping eight 3.5” drives, an
                                additional four 2.5” drives and one 5.25” optical drive, all in an elegant cube form
                                factor. The Node line is a favorite among homelabbers, and it was the perfect choice for
                                me. As I love the cyberpunk style, I've added dozens of tech-themed stickers to the
                                front and side panels from Defcon and other events.</p>

                                dedicate an entire CCD to my gaming VM, giving me the equivalent of an entire 5800x for
                                gaming. The remaining 8 cores are dedicated to Unraid applications and smaller VMs as
                                needs arise. While the absence of an integrated GPU is a pain when trying to access my
                                BIOS, AMD iGPUs are so useless in server tasks (i.e. transcoding and LLMs) that I'd take
                                a higher core count any day.

                            server, expanded RAM became a must. According to my expected needs, 64GB was plenty. I had
                            already known Ryzen 5000 series chips preformed better when using dual-channel RAM, so I
                            chose to opt for four RAM modules— the maximum my motherboard supports. I was troubled to
                            discover, however, that AM4 chips struggle with RAM stability at 3600MT/s across two
                            channels. Because of that, I down-clock my RAM to 3200MT/s. There was no real price
                            difference between 3600MT/S and 3200MT/s, so thankfully I don't feel as though I wasted
                            money on speed I don't use.</p>
