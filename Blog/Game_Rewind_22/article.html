                        <h2>Foreword</h2>
                        <p>2022 was by far one of the most interesting years of my life. I graduated college, moved out
                            of
                            state, and completely changed careers in twelve short months. It was an extremely hard year
                            for
                            me, but just as rewarding. Despite all that was happening in my life, though, it proved to
                            be a
                            great year in gaming. I built a new gaming PC and completed a staggering 27 games and DLC.
                            With the year over, I'd like to reflect on the titles I played in brief, tweet-like
                            considerations on each. Rather than write exhaustive reviews, I'll briefly focus on the
                            merits
                            and demerits I personally found in each title in chronological order.</p>

                        <h2>Rating System</h2>
                        <p>I find number values to be inadequate to accurately describe one's opinions of a game, so
                            using
                            descriptors is my preference. I rate games based on a slightly-adapted version of <a
                                href="https://www.accursedfarms.com/posts/other-videos/gamelistvideo/?v=1">Ross
                                Scott's</a>
                            rating system, which he employs on his similar list of completed and uncompleted games. The
                            system is as follows:
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Fantastic:</b> My life is better because I played these games. It doesn't mean the game
                            has no
                            problems, but the highs are so high I don't care about the lows.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Good/Great:</b> Any game with this rating has my full seal of approval. I had no regrets
                            playing this. Something about it kept it from being one of one of the best gaming
                            experiences I've ever had, but that's not a mark against it.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Hazy:</b> If you ask me what I thought of a game and I have to stop and think about it,
                            then it
                            gets this rating. It's got something going for it, but I beat the game and still don't know
                            how I feel about it.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Love & Hate:</b> These are games that would great if not for very serious issues. These
                            games
                            have extremely strong points underscored by very bad shortcomings.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Doubt:</b> Games like this would probably be “Hazy,” but the longer I play them, the more
                            I want
                            them to be over. These are games that make me feel I was tricked into playing something
                            hollow. These games may still be competent, but not good.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Pass:</b> These are not necessarily bad games. In fact, many of these can be great games.
                            What
                            it means is it's the wrong game. These are games that just aren't for me, but were still
                            finished.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Bad:</b> These are games I played-through completely but I can in no way recommend. These
                            games
                            I probably didn't want to finish but still did out of some sense of resentment or pride.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Retired:</b> These are games that have been retired from the queue due to a misalignment
                            of
                            taste or a shortfall of quality.
                            <br></br>
                            With that established, let's get to it!

                    </div>
                    <p class="">What a way to start the year. I originally was introduced to this game by Jacob Geller's
                        video Fear of Cold. I'm a sucker for city-builders, especially those in unique situations and
                        environments. When I first saw the concept of a steampunk-esque city kept barely alive through
                        an icy apocalypse, I was immediately in love.<br>
                        I won't beat around it, Frostpunk is hard— and it should be. Your objective is to grow your city
                        through a pre-determined series of existential crises while unraveling a narrative about class
                        struggle. How you approach each situation is largely up to the player, and you balance morality
                        in the same way you balance your primary resources. Frostpunk keeps you on your frost-bitten
                        toes, constantly making you think, “If we can sacrifice a little more, make due with a little
                        less, give up just slightly more of our humanity, maybe we can make it.” I was hooked the entire
                        campaign. Only after beating it did I learn that Frostpunk is actually made of multiple
                        campaigns, each telling a new story in a different city's problems. That was an incredible treat
                        to discover. Each campaign is just as harrowing as the next, constantly mixing up mechanics to
                        keep you from being too good at any given start.<br>
                        Frostpunk landed comfortably in my highest rating category for games, and I recommend it to any
                        city-building enthusiast.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="">Coming off the high of Frostpunk, I was incredibly disappointed by what's touted as
                        11-Bit Studios' previous masterwork, This War of Mine. This War of Mine is a game about what is
                        easily Frostpunk's weakest element— morality.<br>
                        Set in a nondescript war-torn city that's
                        definitely not Sarjevo, This War of Mine is a game about gathering resources and keeping a small
                        group of people alive through miserable conditions. I couldn't stand it. This War of Mine fails
                        to add anything new to conversations about conflict. It's entire premise is, “War is bad,” which
                        is easily one of the least controversial statements someone could make. On top of that, I
                        couldn't help but feel it was incredibly insensitive to gamify a real struggle that far-too-many
                        people experience every day. I'd say you might as well make a game about starvation and
                        homelessness, but This War of Mine is already a game about that, too. I put it down after a few
                        days.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="">When I first saw Disco Elysium talked about at The Game Awards in 2019, I thought it
                        looked like a generic far-too-full-of-itself indie walking simulator created by egotist indie
                        developers. I was almost right. Disco Elysium is, however, anything but generic. I first heard
                        Disco Elysium described as, “A detective story at the end of the world,” an admittedly
                        interesting premise. But that undersells it. Disco Elysium's end of the world, The Pale, is a
                        geographic one. The story takes place in a fantastical radio-punk world separated from others by
                        seas of un-reality. That world, though, is really only ever seen in the periphery. It's
                        narrative is far more down-to-earth, almost hauntingly so.<br>
                        Written by self-described communists living in a failed communist state, Disco Elysium takes
                        place entirely within a city known as Martinaise that never truly recovered from a failed
                        communist revolution and it's subsequent foreign occupation. Communism, fascism, and a handful
                        of other in-universe ideologies are duking it out in the streets— the culmination of 10,000
                        years of struggle. But not as armies or faceless ideologies; as people, and as your own
                        thoughts. Unlike any other game I've played, you build your character by strengthening which
                        parts of your literal inner monologue speak the most. These voices constantly comment on one
                        another, your actions, and the events of Disco Elysium's narrative. One of the best moments I've
                        ever experienced in a game was after stepping out of Disco Elysium's starting area— the
                        Whirling-In-Rags— into a rainy Martinaise morning and hearing Shivers richly describe the city
                        in a profoundly poetic monologue. Disco Elysium is full of itself, yes, and it's developers have
                        become infamously narcissistic, but Disco Elysium deserves to take itself seriously. It, and
                        it's writers, have a lot to say worth hearing.<br>
                        Not only do I consider Disco Elysium to be a phenomenal example of what video games can do to
                        set themselves apart from other media, I consider it one of the most important pieces of
                        literature this decade.</p>

                    <p class="">I've been a die-hard Supergiant fan since the launch of Transistor back in 2014.
                        Everything they make is a masterpiece. The weird thing about the discussion surrounding this
                        game, though, is that Hades seems to only be compared to Transistor and never the game that came
                        between that and Hades, Pyre. Hades, to me, feels much more like an evolution of Pyre than any
                        other of Supergiant's other titles. Honestly, Transistor is the least similar Supergiant game to
                        Hades when you bring Bastion into the comparison. Normally I hate rogue-lights and games that
                        require the player to frequently repeat the same content, but Hades is a special case. It's
                        environments, music, and characters make ever play-through extremely engaging. Every run feels
                        like a tangible accomplishment, especially as you start to crank up the difficulty. I'm excited
                        for this one's sequel.</p>

                    <p class="">Yeah, we’re at the fourth “fantastic” rated game on this list so far, but can you blame
                        me? I started 2023 with banger after banger. The next ones won’t all be rated as high, I
                        promise.
                        I’ve played a lot of MMOs in my day. My two most-played games ever are World of Warcraft and EVE
                        Online. When I started college, my interest in WoW fell off a cliff, and I just didn’t have
                        enough time for EVE. I shouldn’t have paid it much mind at the time, but the WoW exodus to FFXIV
                        caught my eye, and I really wanted to try it. After Square Enix closed trial access while they
                        upgraded their servers, I immediately created an account. Boy, am I glad I did.<br>
                        FFXIV is one of the best MMOs I’ve ever played. Its story isn’t incredibly engaging to start
                        with, but once you get past the base vanilla campaign and the pre-heavenward stuff starts, it
                        cranks up to 10. FFXIV excels in emergent gameplay and community, which most other theme-park
                        style MMOs neglect. I love walking into an adventurer’s guild and hearing a group of bards
                        playing music or eavesdropping on conversations by the Limsa Lominsa aetherite.<br>
                        It’s class/job system is also incredibly unique, allowing players to switch between play styles
                        at will. I want to play exclusively healers, so I’m excited to eventually graduate from White
                        Mage and start trying other classes.<br>
                        FFXIV’s singular shortcoming is in world design. While its maps are huge and beautiful, FFXIV
                        never lets the player slow down and enjoy them for long periods. The player is constantly moving
                        from zone to zone, sometimes crossing Eorzea twice in a single quest. Because of that, it’s hard
                        for the player to grow an attachment to the world itself. That attachment is important in an
                        MMO, and it’s the main reason I love both World of Warcraft and EVE Online so much. Maybe once I
                        reach max level and start leveling other classes I’ll finally get to take my time in each zone
                        like I want.</p>
