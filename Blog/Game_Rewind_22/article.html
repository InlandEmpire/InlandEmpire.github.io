                        <h2>Foreword</h2>
                        <p>2022 was by far one of the most interesting years of my life. I graduated college, moved out
                            of
                            state, and completely changed careers in twelve short months. It was an extremely hard year
                            for
                            me, but just as rewarding. Despite all that was happening in my life, though, it proved to
                            be a
                            great year in gaming. I built a new gaming PC and completed a staggering 27 games and DLC.
                            With the year over, I'd like to reflect on the titles I played in brief, tweet-like
                            considerations on each. Rather than write exhaustive reviews, I'll briefly focus on the
                            merits
                            and demerits I personally found in each title in chronological order.</p>

                        <h2>Rating System</h2>
                        <p>I find number values to be inadequate to accurately describe one's opinions of a game, so
                            using
                            descriptors is my preference. I rate games based on a slightly-adapted version of <a
                                href="https://www.accursedfarms.com/posts/other-videos/gamelistvideo/?v=1">Ross
                                Scott's</a>
                            rating system, which he employs on his similar list of completed and uncompleted games. The
                            system is as follows:
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Fantastic:</b> My life is better because I played these games. It doesn't mean the game
                            has no
                            problems, but the highs are so high I don't care about the lows.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Good/Great:</b> Any game with this rating has my full seal of approval. I had no regrets
                            playing this. Something about it kept it from being one of one of the best gaming
                            experiences I've ever had, but that's not a mark against it.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Hazy:</b> If you ask me what I thought of a game and I have to stop and think about it,
                            then it
                            gets this rating. It's got something going for it, but I beat the game and still don't know
                            how I feel about it.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Love & Hate:</b> These are games that would great if not for very serious issues. These
                            games
                            have extremely strong points underscored by very bad shortcomings.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Doubt:</b> Games like this would probably be “Hazy,” but the longer I play them, the more
                            I want
                            them to be over. These are games that make me feel I was tricked into playing something
                            hollow. These games may still be competent, but not good.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Pass:</b> These are not necessarily bad games. In fact, many of these can be great games.
                            What
                            it means is it's the wrong game. These are games that just aren't for me, but were still
                            finished.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Bad:</b> These are games I played-through completely but I can in no way recommend. These
                            games
                            I probably didn't want to finish but still did out of some sense of resentment or pride.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Retired:</b> These are games that have been retired from the queue due to a misalignment
                            of
                            taste or a shortfall of quality.
                            <br></br>
                            With that established, let's get to it!

                    <p class="">What a way to start the year. I originally was introduced to this game by Jacob Geller's
                        video Fear of Cold. I'm a sucker for city-builders, especially those in unique situations and
                        environments. When I first saw the concept of a steampunk-esque city kept barely alive through
                        an icy apocalypse, I was immediately in love.<br>
                        I won't beat around it, Frostpunk is hard— and it should be. Your objective is to grow your city
                        through a pre-determined series of existential crises while unraveling a narrative about class
                        struggle. How you approach each situation is largely up to the player, and you balance morality
                        in the same way you balance your primary resources. Frostpunk keeps you on your frost-bitten
                        toes, constantly making you think, “If we can sacrifice a little more, make due with a little
                        less, give up just slightly more of our humanity, maybe we can make it.” I was hooked the entire
                        campaign. Only after beating it did I learn that Frostpunk is actually made of multiple
                        campaigns, each telling a new story in a different city's problems. That was an incredible treat
                        to discover. Each campaign is just as harrowing as the next, constantly mixing up mechanics to
                        keep you from being too good at any given start.<br>
                        Frostpunk landed comfortably in my highest rating category for games, and I recommend it to any
                        city-building enthusiast.</p>
