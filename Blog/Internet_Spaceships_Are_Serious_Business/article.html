                <p class="standing_para">I'm not often up this late. The falling snow, illuminated by the streetlamp outside my window, dampens the sound of distant passing cars, not that there are many at this hour. It's 3:00 AM, and I know tomorrow morning I'll regret how little sleep tonight will afford me. Though I still have all the obligations of a high school student, I have an additional set of responsibilities that are expected of me, especially lately.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">The silence is broken by intermittent chatter. Various, “hellos,” and, “good mornings,” emanate from my computer as more come online. I stay by the window until the alarm on my phone sounds. I set it as a failsafe on the off-chance my nerves didn't wake me up early. It proved unnecessary after all. What keeps me awake tonight is the role I play in an MMO, EVE Online, to be precise.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">I'm considered relatively new, with only about a year of experience in the game under my belt. Despite my best efforts, the complicated geo-political landscape of the EVE's player-controlled map, an outer-ring of the digital galaxy “New Eden,” has proven difficult to decipher. What I've been able to piece together so far is this: we're a “nullsec” alliance, meaning that where we live is completely player controlled. Its economy, its resources, its culture— are all emergent, player-made phenomenon enabled by the sandbox of EVE Online. Our alliance is based out of a region known as “Providence,” which is currently controlled by a coalition of player organizations known as the “Provi Bloc.” It's not particularly wealthy space, and none of the alliances that make up the Provi Bloc are true galactic contenders. What sets us apart, however, is that we adhere to an unorthodox set of rules. Whereas the majority of nullsec has an NBSI (Not Blue, Shoot It) engagement doctrine, the aim of the Provi Bloc is to establish a space in the otherwise anarchical domain of nullsec where players can travel, hunt bounties, and gather resources safely as long as they adhere to the rules. Chiefly, this means to not attack other players unless they're known rule-breakers. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">Keeping track of these players has been simplified into a straightforward system. When a player enters space controlled by anyone in our coalition, our “eyes”— a term used to refer to a vast network of players continually monitoring our space— report it in our regional intel channel. This intel channel is the official intelligence-gathering platform we use to keep track of any suspicious activity in our collective space. While most contributors report encounters as they work in systems or travel somewhere along the regions stargate network, a number of players have alternate, paid accounts, the entire purpose of which is to sit some distance from a system entry-point and report anyone who passes through. If you're close to a system where non-friendly player activity was reported, you can enter the player character's name into a website hosted by the coalition. The website checks if they're “neut”—  free to pass but not necessarily trusted, or “red”— free to engage at-will. Because of this complex and discriminatory aggression practice, our doctrine is known as NRDS (Not Red, Don't Shoot).</p>
                <p class="standing_para">While most of the alliances in our coalition are modestly sized— making up ten to twenty player corporations and taking up dozens of systems— ours is tiny, effectively containing only three “corps”— the smallest unit of organized players— and controlling only two systems clear out on the edge of the Provi Bloc's domain. This, in addition to the largely free economic zone of Providence, puts us in an interesting position. We're able to get away with bending the rules from time to time so long as we aren't being too loud or aggressive when we shouldn't be. In this moment, we intend to capitalize on that. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">Bordering our space is a “lowsec” or low-security system, one that isn't formally controlled by any player organization and has NPC rules in effect but little consequence for breaking them. That border system in particular happens to be the new home of a recently-created, independent alliance made to rapidly recruit and train new players in the ways of EVE Online called Brave Newbies. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">Though Brave Newbies is officially red to us, we hope they'll contribute to the economic prosperity of the zone. They have little idea how to effectively fight, and they burn through ships, modules, and other supplies at a rapid pace. If we set up an industrial outpost station in that border system with competitive usage fees and trade taxes, we'd be in a position to produce and sell our enemies exactly the resources that they desperately need— profiting every time we annihilate one of their fleets. Over the past months, when not policing our systems or participating in coalition ops, we'd been pooling our resources— strip mining our systems' asteroid belts every day to build up our capacity to operate such a station. Tonight, T-minus one hour to server downtime, that's our goal.</p>
                <p class="standing_para"><br>“Alright, guys,” our fleet commander, colloquially referred to as “the FC,” says over comms, her tone clearly exhausted.<br><br>
                    "Freighter is getting into position. How's 4B looking?”<br><br>
                    Turning from the window and taking a seat at my desk, I hear a low-pitched popping sound as the freighter in question drops out of warp, coasting into formation with the rest of us. We've been waiting in position inside a POS, a player-owned structure with a massive shield around it, while the heavy-lifters of this morning's operation get the final stages ready.<br><br>
                    “4B is clear, as are the neighboring systems. I think we're good to go,” our eyes replies.<br><br>
                    “Okay then. Everyone already knows the drill. Align 4B-NQN gate, 75% speed. It'll take a while for the freighter to align. Once it is, I'll fleetwarp. Jump on contact and hold.”<br></p>
                <p class="standing_para">There's no response to the FC's orders, just silent obedience as is protocol. EVE Online lends itself to a specific kind of role-play, one that's particularly evident in its fleet and command structures. You don't fall into line like a military grunt because it's fun, you do it because you want to live. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">Everything in EVE Online is earned over hours of genuine work. What you have can be lost in a fraction of the time it took to get. When your ship explodes, you lose evert hour it took to get there. Every undock is an investment. Every encounter is a risk. Every loss is tangible. That's why even at this early hour— even when there's no sign of our enemies, we consider it our duty to be here. The unexpected can still happen, and hundreds of man-hours were invested in this project mining and processing materials, negotiating for components, and surveying its feasibility.</p>
                <p class="standing_para"> Earlier in the week we'd already had a tense moment while transporting additional critical materials required for the station. We'd formed up a substantial fleet to escort our freighter through high, low, and nullsec space. While in “highsec,” one is usually safe. It's controlled and rigidly policed by NPCs that prevent most aggression, but for a high-value target, suicide ganking is not unheard of. It's in such space a PVP fleet happened to pass through and spot us— a number of well armed and tightly-formed ships escorting a cargo freighter. While its specific contents and monetary value were kept a secret even from us, it's obvious whatever it contained was expensive. Very expensive. That would also be clear to whoever saw us, in this case a fleet eager to get a shiny kill. Our two fleets stood still, fingers itchy to start locking targets, but both parties waiting until an order to do anything. The commanders of our fleet and the enemy fleet meet in a separate Teamspeak server to discuss and negotiate. Luckily, they know one another from a different era of their EVE lives, and an unknown favor is called to let us pass without incident.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Remembering that, even in relative safety, you're only moments away from losing everything, no precautions are spared tonight. My warp drive spools as the FC issues a fleet-wide warp order. I activate the stargate from 9-F0B2 to 4B-NQN and hold still on the other side with the rest of my fleet. We wait for confirmation that everyone made it through, a process that takes almost two minutes. The FC warps us to a catalogued point off the horizon of the closest planet to the system's sun. It's barren, and its pale brown surface quickly comes into view as I drop out of warp. The freighter pulls off to the side and dumps its contents: an outpost assembly platform and a huge number of mineral resources. The rest of us stay in formation while the process completes, all of us aware of our roles if push comes to shove.</p>
                <p class="standing_para"><br>“I think we're good.” I hear someone say.<br><br>I glance up at the clock, watching the final seconds until 11:00 UTC. When the hour strikes, we're immediately disconnected from the server. With the others, I cheer over comms at our mission's success. In 15 minutes, once EVE's server maintenance is complete, our station will be finished— a permanent fixture in the game's persistent universe. From then on, we have a place of our own to easily capitalize on industrial pursuits, providing the opportunity for all of us to become incredibly wealthy.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">2013, the year of the birth of 4B-NQN's only station, has long since passed. The alliance I flew with has disbanded, and its members gone on to brighter prospects. The Provi Bloc was broken in civil war and a changing galactic political landscape. Despite my enormous love for the game and repeated, earnest attempts to reintegrate myself into it, I haven't been able to for one reason that sets it apart from any other space game on the market. It's why EVE Online is the only multiplayer space sim that has managed to last as long as it has— 19 years at the time of writing, and why I was willing to get up before dawn on a school day as a teenager.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">EVE Online isn't a game. It's a lifestyle. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">If you're like me, you grew up with Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, Stargate, or any other number of space epics. As a kid, I always wanted to explore a universe just as rich and engaging as the ones our favorite characters do. Hell, I still want to. Video games are the perfect medium for that experience. Maybe we're born to early to explore distant star systems ourselves, but we absolutely have the technology to explore vast virtual galaxies. Many games have tried to emulate the exact same feeling we seek, but only EVE Online has managed to capture it.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">The recurring fallacy most games fall into is the belief that space itself is the single-most important ingredient in the sci-fi recipe, but it's not. It's simply an aesthetic medium through which we tell stories about adventure. Space's role in these stories is to diversify the number of possible settings and encounters in addition to setting an atmospheric standard, nothing more.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Two recent commercial attempts have seen varying degrees of success in the endeavor, each focussing on a different approach: Elite: Dangerous and No Man's Sky.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Frontier Development's 2014 space simulator Elite: Dangerous is an ambitious revival of the classic Elite franchise that first debuted on BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computer systems in 1984. Like its predecessor, it seeks a high standard of technical sophistication in simulation. An entire procedurally generated Milky Way galaxy has been immaculately built, replete with known systems and other stellar phenomenon in addition to over 400 billion systems, only a minuscule fraction of which have been seen by player eyes. Piloting Elite: Dangerous's diverse lineup of ships is a dream, as is being able to land on planets, dock at stations, and boldly go where no man has gone before— especially in VR. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">Players occupy themselves by exploring, station trading, or doing combat missions. Unfortunately, players will quickly discover that's *all* there is to do. While technically a multiplayer game, encountering another player is exceedingly rare. Its market is influenced by player trading, but is not at all player controlled. Very few resources in game are used for any purpose by the player other than to trade between NPC stations. There's no industry in Elite: Dangerous— no real economy or player construction. There's almost no player interaction, and absolutely no player effect on the world. The universe is completely static. Sure, you can chart a system for the first time and land on a world no one's ever seen before, but what can you do there? What experiences are there to be had?</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Think back to sci-fi stories in other media. Did the thrill of watching the Enterprise trail blaze come from how it handled near gravitational bodies? Did it come from watching it safely shuttle passengers back and forth through the Neutral Zone? 
                    <br>Not at all. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">The fun came from unique situations where characters were forced to find solutions to difficult problems. It came from experiences that made for interesting stories. The events of these stories often have consequences, too. The characters in them live in dynamic and rich worlds, constantly ebbing and flowing like our own.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Two players landing on barren rocks 20,000 light years away from one another in Elite: Dangerous are having the same experience. Sure, the planets are different in some way, but there's nothing on any of them. There are no experiences to be had other than getting to say “I was the first on this planet,” something that carries no weight whatsoever when there are hundreds of billions of others exactly like it. Players go through the mechanical act of exploring, but get none of what makes exploration compelling. The same thing goes for space trading.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Sure, most of hauling cargo between locations is mechanically uneventful, but is Cowboy Bebop? Is Firefly? Elite: Dangerous in no way lends itself to providing players with enriching, meaningful experiences— just the motions of theoretical sci-fi careers. There's no risk or reward; no unexpected encounters that force players to think on their toes. No one comes away from Elite: Dangerous with stories to tell.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Hello Games' No Man's Sky took another swing at the sci-fi experience in 2016 when it released on PC and eighth generation consoles, slowly receiving updates over the following years until it eclipsed most competitors in the space-sim scene.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Like Elite: Dangerous, No Man's Sky is an exploration-based space simulator hosting a massive procedurally generated universe. Unlike Elite: Dangerous, however, No Man's Sky focuses far less on realism in favor of providing a more diverse backdrop of environments and player construction mechanics. This difference is highly significant in outcome for the player. Immediately, No Man's Sky makes itself open-ended. Whereas Elite: Dangerous answers the question, “What can I do?” with, “Trade, explore, and fight,” No Man's Sky answer's it with, “Build.” The vision of the experience then becomes the player's.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">In this sense, No Man's Sky sets itself up as a sandbox not dissimilar from Minecraft. Players follow an introductory, guiding series of events but are free to deviate as they choose to. The worlds all have believable, procedurally generated ecosystems that make each seem dynamic, even if they're artificial. It breaks the immediate monotony evident in Elite: Dangerous, and puts players more inline with feeling like a genuine explorer. When a player finds an animal, that animal truly does not exist anywhere else.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">There's an incredible amount to see, and the ways in which each world can be experienced are numerous and player-unique. Imagination and player creativity also provide fantastic motivators that push players into the title's environments, providing more opportunity for memorable occurrences. In building their bases, players are required to seek out materials that only appear on specific types of planets. Gathering and crafting happens in this now-prominent gameplay loop abundant in survival games. Just like those survival games, however, players may find that the content begins to stretch thin over a long period. Patterns begin to manifest in the unknown, and even new experiences feel familiar, as any Minecraft player knows well.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Some sandbox games, particularly multiplayer survival games, get around this problem by introducing a human element. More participants equate to a higher degree of cause and effect. Emergent gameplay then manifests as players interact with one another, compete for or share resources, and work towards their goals. Survival games typically keep the temporal, geographical, and consequential scope of these experiences small. Players walk away with stories and unique experiences, but they're self-contained— often ending with no lasting influence on the space they occurred in. Unfortunately, the sheer size of No Man's Sky prevents true conflict between players. At its most interesting, player encounters are artificial, prearranged co-operative endeavors. 
                    <br>In a universe of over 18 quintillion resource-rich planets, scarcity and competition do not exist.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Built specifically around scarcity, EVE Online's approach is as a true MMO. There is no single-player experience present in the game. Everything down to its most basic gameplay involves another player. Its economy is almost entirely player-driven, with only a small fraction of items for sale stocked by NPCs. The overwhelming majority of every ship undocked, every drone launched, every weapon discharged, and every round fired were crafted by a player. Maybe that player spent hours mining the materials themselves, or maybe they bought them off someone else. Regardless, someone somewhere spent their own sweat (and often tears) to make those things. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">EVE Online's industry and economy is natural. It's *real* in the truest sense of the word. Needs are filled, profitably, by those that can fill them. The very foundation of the galaxy has a pulse, and it changes as player interests clash. Wars can cause economic booms and busts, just as in the real world. A clash over territory in one region can be felt economically in another as systems of alliances react to compensate for political or economic changes. This breathing, virtual world is as richly complex as the one it exists in. Identifying one aspect of any event in EVE Online does a disservice if it ignores the thousands of other contributing factors and decades-long game history that lead to that point. EVE Online behaves identically to the real world, and because of that, people have to act within it the same way. There's a responsibility shouldered by all EVE players to fill the roles required of them by their community. Not roles as simple as needing a healer for a raid, but roles as demanding as being night watch for communally owned assets worth thousands of real-world dollars.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Like the we see in our favorite sci-fi stories, EVE Online players have responsibility. They have vested, meaningful interests in the occurrences of the galaxy and their behaviors within it. Just as they don't let down their colleagues at work, they can't skip their duties in EVE without the consequence. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">There's a common saying among EVE players, <b>“Internet spaceships are serious business.”</b> It's said with an air of adamant self-awareness. The underlying meaning is, “Yes, this is over pixels in a game, but they're pixels we've spent years earning. Of course we're not going to let our investment go to waste.” </p>
                <p class="standing_para">EVE Online succeeds in fulfilling the quintessential sci-fi experience because it isn't an attempt at simulating a universe, it *is* a universe. Living in it is as demanding as living in two complete societies at the same time. Most people can't handle that much, particularly for a video game. At its height, only about 500,000 players were subscribed, with most estimates putting it at ~300,000 at the time of writing. As an adult having to provide for himself with a number of passions I love pursuing, I haven't been able to find a balance that positions EVE as only a hobby. </p>
                <p class="standing_para">When I play it, I'm not able to do anything else with my free time. To me and the overwhelming majority of other people that have played, the tradeoff simply isn't one that can be made. Being an EVE player as a working adult is often equated with having two full-time jobs, but how could it work any differently? Our favorite sci-fi characters get the experiences they have because of their lifestyles— because of their work. EVE Online provides that in the most earnest way possible.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">Despite its difficulty and the daunting responsibilities placed upon players, I consider it something every sci-fi diehard should attempt, at least for a little bit. I consider my years in EVE some of the brightest I've ever had in gaming. The endless tense, exhilarating moments I shared with my wing mates, the war-forged bonds we shared, the stories we've gotten to tell; those are things I'll always remember.</p>
                <p class="standing_para">EVE Online let me live the lifestyle needed to capture the magic sci-fi carries in other forms of media. As long as other games neglect experience in favor of technicality, it'll be the only one that ever does it right.</p>
