                        <h2>Rating System</h2>
                        <p>I rate games based on a slightly-adapted version of <a
                                href="https://www.accursedfarms.com/posts/other-videos/gamelistvideo/?v=1">Ross
                                Scott's</a>
                            rating system, which he employs on his similar list of completed and uncompleted games. The
                            system is as follows:
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Fantastic:</b> My life is better because I played these games. It doesn't mean the game
                            has no
                            problems, but the highs are so high I don't care about the lows.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Good/Great:</b> Any game with this rating has my full seal of approval. I had no regrets
                            playing this. Something about it kept it from being one of one of the best gaming
                            experiences I've ever had, but that's not a mark against it.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Hazy:</b> If you ask me what I thought of a game and I have to stop and think about it,
                            then it
                            gets this rating. It's got something going for it, but I beat the game and still don't know
                            how I feel about it.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Love & Hate:</b> These are games that would great if not for very serious issues. These
                            games
                            have extremely strong points underscored by very bad shortcomings.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Doubt:</b> Games like this would probably be “Hazy,” but the longer I play them, the more
                            I want
                            them to be over. These are games that make me feel I was tricked into playing something
                            hollow. These games may still be competent, but not good.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Pass:</b> These are not necessarily bad games. In fact, many of these can be great games.
                            What
                            it means is it's the wrong game. These are games that just aren't for me, but were still
                            finished.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Bad:</b> These are games I played-through completely but I can in no way recommend. These
                            games
                            I probably didn't want to finish but still did out of some sense of resentment or pride.
                            <br></br>
                            <b>Retired:</b> These are games that have been retired from the queue due to a misalignment
                            of
                            taste or a shortfall of quality.
